Flat Area Detection for Drone Landing 🚁


This project detects flat areas inside a yellow-bounded arena using an Intel RealSense D455 depth camera. The goal is to identify a safe landing zone for an autonomous drone.

✅ RealSense D455 integration for depth sensing
✅ Flat area detection using OpenCV & NumPy
✅ Yellow boundary detection for arena recognition
✅ MAVROS integration (optional) for drone landing
